Hello, students.

In this "lesson", I'll be teaching you how to install Python and IDLE, which are two very important systems used for Computer Science and Programming in general.

## Installing Python

Python's installation is quite simplistic. Follow the following steps:

1. Go to https://www.python.org/ and click on the Downloads page as indicated below:<br><br>![Go to www.python.org and go to the Downloads page](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/pythonorg.png?raw=true)

2. Scroll down to "Looking for a specific release?" and locate version `3.8.7`. Click on the Download button as shown below:<br><br>![Locate version `3.8.7`](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/v387.png?raw=true)

3. Scroll down and choose the preferable version based on your computer's Operating System as shown below:<br><br>![Install the Recommended Releases](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/files-for-install.jpg?raw=true)

4. Open the installed file, which launches the following wizard. Make sure to click "Add Python 3.8 to PATH" as shown and confirm installation:<br><br>![Installation Wizard - Confirmation Screen](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/installation_confirmation.png?raw=true)<br><br>Now, wait for the installation. You should see the following screen for a long while, and wait till the entire bar is green:<br><br>![Installation Wizard - Installation Screen](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/installation_process.png?raw=true)<br><br>Once the installation is complete, you should see the following screen. For now, you can ignore the "Disable path limit" warning. Simply go ahead and close the wizard as shown:<br><br>![Installation Wizard - Successful Screen](https://github.com/M22504/coding-workshop/blob/master/wiki/installation_successful.png?raw=true)

And there, you've installed Python!

Wait, not so fast. Your Python Version may not have been installed properly. If you run into any major problems, you can raise any questions you may have by emailing us.
