## Agenda
1. Using `print` and `input` functions
2. Accessing IDLE

## A Brief Introduction to Python
Python was introduced back in the 1980s, then still a relative unknown language that surged in popularity in the recent years due to it's easy-to-use syntax, readable code, access to powerful libraries and many more. Python is a language known for its versatility in programming paradigms and simply being quite easy to use. In fact, Python scored [a **perfect score** on the IEEE Spectrum Ranking for the Top Programming Languages](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages/#/index/2021/1/1/1/1/1/50/1/50/1/50/1/30/1/30/1/20/1/20/1/5/1/50/1/100/1/50/). It is well-applied in domains such as Web Development (with frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.dev/)), Scientific Computing and Data Science (with libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine/Deep Learning (with frameworks like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)).

## Introducing IDLE
IDLE is an application developed by the Python Software Foundation. This app is one of the most useful Python essentials, since it works as a code editor and incorporates the Python Shell, which is one of the most important tools you will use in Python. In our experience, you can do most of your coding for this module on IDLE, but if you're more experienced, you can also use Microsoft's Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code or JetBrains' PyCharm IDE. You can also access the Python Shell from the Terminal (Command Prompt on Windows), although Terminal may not be the easiest to use in general, hence we suggest using IDLE.

Alright, so, how to you use IDLE?
